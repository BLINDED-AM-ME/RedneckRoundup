Naming assets: “whatItIsFor_whatItIs”

	examples KillerRobot_mesh
		 KillerRobot_mainTexture
		 Puppy_sprite
		 Puppy_bark

Placing assets: There are folders for each type of asset
	All assets by us will be put in a folder in the TeamAssets folder
		which itself is in the Assets folder.
	Your assets will be 3 levels deep.
	Everything outside of the TeamAssets folder
		will be from importing packages and plugins.

	examples sprites go in the Sprites folder
		 scripts go in the Scripts folder
